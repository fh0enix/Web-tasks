                <h1>A Brief History Of The New York Yankees</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>The New York Yankees are a major league baseball (MLB)
                        team based in The Bronx, New York.
                        <br><br>They’re one of two of New York City’s MLB teams
                        (the other being the New York Mets) and are one of the
                        most successful sports teams in the world.
                        <br><br>They’ve won 27 World Series championships and 18
                        division titles – both records within the MLB.
                        <br><br>Forty-four of their players are in the National
                        Baseball Hall of Fame, along with 11 of their managers.
                        <br><br>Beloved by New Yorkers and hated by Red Sox
                        fans, no matter how you feel about them, the New York
                        Yankees are iconic.
                        <br><br>The team originated in 1901 as the Baltimore
                        Orioles (different from the modern-day Baltimore
                        Orioles) and was moved to NYC and renamed the New York
                        Highlanders. By 1913, the team’s name had been changed
                        to the New York Yankees, and the name stayed.
